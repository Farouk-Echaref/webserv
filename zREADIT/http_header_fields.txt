The use of entity tag:

In HTTP, an entity tag (ETag) is an HTTP header that is used to identify a specific version of a resource, such as a web page or file, that is available on a web server. An ETag is typically used to help optimize the performance of web applications by reducing the amount of data that needs to be transmitted between a server and a client.

When a client requests a resource from a web server, the server can include an ETag header in the response that contains a unique identifier for the resource. The client can then use this identifier to determine whether it needs to download a new version of the resource or whether it can use a cached version that it has already downloaded.

If the client already has a cached version of the resource, it can include the ETag value in a conditional request to the server, along with other information such as the If-Modified-Since header. The server can then compare the ETag value with the current version of the resource on the server, and if they match, it can send a "304 Not Modified" response to indicate that the cached version can be used. If the ETag values do not match, the server can send the updated version of the resource to the client.

The use of ETags can help to reduce the amount of data that needs to be transmitted between a server and a client, and can improve the performance of web applications by reducing the number of unnecessary downloads of resources that have not changed. However, it is important to note that the use of ETags can also have some drawbacks, such as increased server load and storage requirements, and potential issues with caching when multiple servers are used.



Last-modified:

most recent modification time of the document requested by the client.
this modification time is often used for caching purposes a browser may not need to request the 
entire HTML file again if it hasn't changed , it will just use the cached one.


Etag vs last-modified:

Although ETag and Last-Modified headers serve similar purposes, they are used in different ways and have different strengths and weaknesses.

The Last-Modified header is useful for determining whether a resource has been modified since a specific date and time. The client can send a request to the server with the If-Modified-Since header, which contains the value of the Last-Modified header from the last time the client downloaded the resource. If the server's Last-Modified value is newer than the client's, the server sends a new copy of the resource to the client. Otherwise, the server sends a "304 Not Modified" response, indicating that the client's cached copy is still valid.

On the other hand, ETag provides a way to determine whether a resource has changed based on its content, not just its modification time. The ETag value is typically calculated based on the content of the resource, as well as other factors such as the content encoding and language. When the client requests the resource again, it sends the ETag value back to the server in the If-None-Match header. If the server's ETag value matches the client's, the server sends a "304 Not Modified" response. Otherwise, the server sends the updated resource.

Using both Last-Modified and ETag headers provides additional flexibility and redundancy in the caching process. If a server supports both headers, the client can use the Last-Modified header as the first level of caching, and the ETag header as a fallback mechanism in case the Last-Modified value is not accurate or the server does not support it.

Overall, the use of both Last-Modified and ETag headers allows for more efficient and accurate caching of resources in HTTP.



http message structure :
1. The first line tells the client which method to use, which entity
(document) to apply it to, and which version of HTTP the client is
using. Possible HTTP 1.1 methods are GET, POST, HEAD, PUT,
LINK, UNLINK, DELETE, OPTIONS, and TRACE. HTTP 1.0 does
not support the OPTIONS or TRACE method. Not all methods need
be supported by a server.
The URL specifies the location of a document to apply the method
to. Each server may have its own way of translating the URL string
into some form of usable resource. For example, the URL may
represent a document to transmit to the client. Or the URL may
actually map to a program, the output of which is sent to the client.
Finally, the last entry on the first line specifies the version of HTTP
the client is using.
2. General message headers are optional headers used in both the
client request and server response. They indicate general
information such as the current time or the path through a network
that the client and server are using.
3. Request headers tell the server more information about the client.
The client can identify itself and the user to the server, and specify
preferred document formats that it would like to see from the server.
4. Entity headers are used when an entity (a document) is about to be
sent. They specify information about the entity, such as encoding
schemes, length, type, and origin.


HTTP/1.1 Methods:
A client request method is a command or request that a web client issues to a server. You can
think of the method as the declaration of the client's intentions. There are exceptions, of course,
but here are some generalizations:

You can think of a GET request as meaning that you just want to retrieve a resource on the
server. This resource could be the contents of a static file or invoke a program that
generates data.

A HEAD request means that you just want some information about the document, but don't
need the document itself.

A POST request says that you're providing some information of your own (generally used
for fill-in forms). This typically changes the state of the server in some way. For example, it
could create a record in a database.

PUT is used to provide a new or replacement document to be stored on the server.

DELETE is used to remove a document on the server.

TRACE asks that proxies declare themselves in the headers, so the client can learn the
path that the document took (and thus determine where something might have been
garbled or lost). This is used for protocol debugging purposes.

OPTIONS is used when the client wants to know what other methods can be used for that
document (or for the server at large).

CONNECT is used when a client needs to talk to a HTTPS server through a proxy server.
