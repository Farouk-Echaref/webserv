HTTP Messages
HTTP messages are how data is exchanged between a server and a client.
 There are two types of messages: requests sent by the client to trigger an action on the server,
  and responses, the answer from the server.

HTTP messages are composed of textual information encoded in ASCII,
 and span over multiple lines. In HTTP/1.1, and earlier versions of the protocol, these messages
  were openly sent across the connection. In HTTP/2, the once human-readable message is now divided up into HTTP frames, providing optimization and performance improvements.

Web developers, or webmasters, rarely craft these textual HTTP messages
 themselves: software, a Web browser, proxy, or Web server, perform this action. They provide 
 HTTP messages through config files (for proxies or servers), APIs (for browsers), or other interfaces.
