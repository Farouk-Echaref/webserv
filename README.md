This is when you finally understand why a URL starts with HTTP!


What is an RFC?

RFCs are often the result of collaborative efforts among members of the technical community, who contribute their expertise and feedback to refine a proposal. It is the type of document that is used by technical community to propose new ideas, standars, protocols and provide solutions for given problems RFCs are published by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and other organizations involved in developing and maintaining Internet standards.
RFC contains technical specifications about a certain problem and provides solutions and new ideas to help solving it, 

Why is RFC important?

As I mentiend before the RFC is a document that provide specification about a protocol It is a type of reference to any developer that includes guidance on best practices and common pitfalls and dangers to avoid when implementing a protocol or standard. By following these recommendations, you can improve the performance, security, and reliability of your software.

if you are creating a server, you may need to implement a protocol such as HTTP to communicate with other servers and clients. The RFCs that describe these protocols provide detailed  specifications that you can follow to ensure that your server is compliant with the protocol and can interoperate with other servers and clients.

RFC && Http ?
the HTTP protocol was first proposed in RFC 1945 in May 1996, and has since been revised and updated in subsequent RFCs to reflect changes and improvements to the protocol.


The http protocol belongs to the Application layer of the OSI model , and even if we implement it, it will not be able to do its job wthout t its  Transport Layer  which is TCP protocol.

TCP implemenation :
To implement TCP, we have to learn TCP socket programming first .

What is a socket?

A socket it a mechanism that provides computer applications a way to the Network, it is an end point communication between two or more  processes (or Applications  ) from and to anywhere in the world (e.g, sending an email to a friend) .

It allows messages to be sent and received between applications ,  A good  analogy of creating a socket is that of requesting a telephone line from the phone company.
